# **Special Session Aims and Scope**

<div style="text-align: justify"> The fusion of scalable computing infrastructure, big data, and artificial intelligence has boosted the development and application of data science and advanced data analytics. However, the recently emerging threats on the privacy, security, and trust (PST) of the data and the analytics models have shown a dramatically increasing trend with the wide deployment of data analytics applications. Specifically, the PST attacks on data or models such as model inversion attacks, membership inference attacks, data poisoning attacks, evasion attacks, and model backdoors, have severely made advanced data analytics highly vulnerable, particularly in common scenarios where data are distributed or computation is outsourced like MLaaS (Machine Learning as a Service). On the other hand, defence solutions are proposed as new computing schemes, PST frameworks, algorithms, and methods. For example, differential privacy, federated learning, and machine unlearning are proposed for privacy protection in data analytics, and adversarial machine learning is proposed to achieve robust, secure, and trustworthy data analytics. Given the importance and urgency, this special issue aims to provide a venue for researchers, practitioners and developers from different background areas relevant to PST and data analytics to exchange their latest experience, research ideas, and synergic research and development on fundamental issues and applications about privacy, security, and trust issues in data analytics, as a strong supplement to the main track of data science and advanced analytics. </div> 

<br/>

<div style="text-align: justify"> This special session mainly focuses on the discussions of privacy, security, and trust in data analytics, which generally covers (but not limited to) the topics in privacy-preserving technology, privacy attacks, federated learning, machine unlearning, data poisoning attacks, model evasion attacks, adversarial learning, model robustness, secure machine learning integrating cryptographic techniques, blockchain techniques protection PST of data and models, etc.</div>

<br/>

<div style="text-align: justify"> Accepted research papers will be included in the ADMA 2025 proceedings.</div>

    <div style="text-align: justify"> c. Authors and reviewers alike make an honest effort to avoid accidentally de-blinding any submission.</div>

5. <div style="text-align: justify">The list of authors at the time of submission is final and cannot be changed.</div>

6. <div style="text-align: justify">"Submitted papers" must comply with all of the rules below. Any violation may result in an "desk reject".</div>
<!-- - <div style="text-align: justify"> The length of each paper submitted should be no more than 10 pages, and formatted following the standard 2-column U.S. letter style of IEEE Conference template. See the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE Proceedings Author Guidelines</a> for further information and instructions.</div>
- <div style="text-align: justify"> All submissions will be double-blind reviewed by the Program Committee on the basis of technical quality, relevance to the scope of the special session, originality, significance, and clarity.

<!-- **Submission portal:** [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ADMA2022](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ADMA2022) -->

<!-- <div style="text-align: justify"> Special session papers strictly follow the same specifications, requirements, and policies as the main conference submissions in terms of paper formatting and length and important policies. Reviewing the submissions in each special session is coordinated by the special session organizers and is fully aligned to the main conference evaluation process. See [ADMA203 Important Policies](https://conferences.sigappfr.org/ADMA2023/cfp-for-special-sessions-track/) for more details. In particular: </div>

<br/> -->
**Manuscript Preparation:**
1. <div style="text-align: justify"> Authors must submit PDFs without author names and affiliations. Submitted PDFs must also not contain any metadata that could reveal author identities or affiliations.</div>

2. <div style="text-align: justify"> Authors should aim to avoid copy&pasting substantial amounts of text from their own prior publications, as such text blocks may be readily recognized by experts familiar with the state of the art and recent papers in the area.</div>

3. <div style="text-align: justify"> Similarly, authors should not directly reuse figures from their own prior publications without attribution. Ideally, “fresh” figures should be prepared and used whenever possible. If that is not a viable option, that is, if a figure must be reused, then a citation should be included giving credit to the original paper from which the illustration has been adapted.</div>

4. <div style="text-align: justify"> Authors must refrain from using any specific formatting tricks, linguistic mannerisms, figure styles, or other stylistic idioms that could hint at or disclose the author identity or affiliation.</div>

5. <div style="text-align: justify"> Submitted papers should not include an acknowledgements section or funding acknowledgements (even when blinded) since it can indicate the country of residence of (some of) the authors. (Such acknowledgements of course may be added to the camera-ready version.)</div>

6. <div style="text-align: justify"> Authors who seek to refer to an online appendix or to supplemental materials (e.g., source code, videos, etc.) may still do so. However, instead of directly providing a URL or tech report number, authors should include a note that the appendices and/or supplemental materials in question are available from the track chair upon request.</div>

    <div style="text-align: justify"> a. Authors must provide all supplemental materials and/or appendices that a submission refers to in blinded form and sent them to the PC chair by email (or other approaches appointed by the PC chair) before the submission deadline.</div>

    <div style="text-align: justify"> b. The track chair will retain a copy of all submitted materials for the duration of the reviewing process. Any such provided appendices or supplemental materials are not subject to review and may be consulted by the reviewers at their own discretion.</div>

7. <div style="text-align: justify"> It is imperative to acknowledge the contributions of AI models in the generation of textual content. Authors utilizing AI-generated text in their manuscripts are required to assume full responsibility for the accuracy, integrity, and originality of the material presented. Furthermore, any section of the paper employing AI-generated text should include clear documentation and description of the AI system utilized. This transparency ensures that readers can discern between human-authored content and text generated by AI, fostering a culture of accountability and integrity within the scholarly community.</div>
<!-- - <div style="text-align: justify"> All accepted full-length special session papers will be published by IEEE in the ADMA main conference proceedings under its Special Session scheme. All papers will be submitted for inclusion in the IEEEXplore Digital Library. The conference proceedings will be submitted for EI indexing through INSPEC by IEEE.</div> -->

<!-- 
- Submissions must be original work and should not be under submission to other venues at the time of review.

- The length of each paper submitted to the special session should be no more than 10 pages, and the papers should be formatted following the standard 2-column U.S. letter style of IEEE Conference template. See the IEEE Proceedings Author Guidelines: [http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html](http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html), for further information and instructions.

- Authors are also encouraged to submit supplementary materials, i.e., providing the source code and data through a GitHub-like public repository to support the reproducibility of their research results.
    
- Papers will then be assigned to appropriate PCMs by the Special Session organizers for review.
    
- Special Session organizers will make recommendations of acceptance/rejection for papers in their sessions, which must be validated by General chairs, Research, and Application track chairs.

**Own Prior Work, Well-Known Projects, and Research Artifacts**

1. <div style="text-align: justify"> Authors should not upload their manuscript to preprint servers (such as arXiv) or their personal websites while the paper is under review, or otherwise publicly reveal their authorship of the manuscript under review.</div>

2. <div style="text-align: justify"> As an exception to the previous rule, if a prior version of the manuscript has already been uploaded to a public preprint server prior to submission (e.g., if the paper is a re-submission of a paper previously rejected at another single-blind conference), then the paper may still be submitted to ADMA2025. However, such papers must be blinded when submitted to ADMA2025.</div>

3. <div style="text-align: justify"> In exceptional circumstances that force a violation of the above two rules (e.g., a technical report or thesis must be filed in order for a student to graduate), the authors should contact the Program Chair prior to publicizing their manuscript content to avoid misunderstandings.</div>

4. <div style="text-align: justify"> When submitting or extending a prior workshop publication, the workshop paper is treated as an online preprint for the purpose of the double-blind peer-review process. However, authors must proactively disclose the existence of a prior workshop version of a submitted paper. Such information should be emailed to the Program Chair. Failure to disclose a prior workshop publication is considered self-plagiarism.</div>

5. <div style="text-align: justify"> After communicating with the Program Chair, submissions with conditions 2., 3., or 4. above are recommended to add a headline (or footer) on the first page with the following information: “This submission is based on Preprints, Paper Announcements, and Prior Workshop Papers. The information has been communicated with the Program Chair. The author(s) and the Program Chair request the reviewers not to actively search for the author names to ensure fairness of the double-blind review process.” Please contact the Program Chair at least 24 hours before the submission deadline if this applies to your submission. If the paper is accepted, the above text should be removed and appropriate citations if any should be added (e.g., citation for prior workshop paper, technical report or thesis and its relation to the accepted paper).</div>

6. <div style="text-align: justify"> If your submission is an extended version of a workshop paper with DOI, you will be asked to provide a blinded version of the workshop paper as supplementary material. This will be used by the reviewers to verify that there is sufficient amount of new material in the extended version to warrant a publication at ADMA2025.</div>

<!-- <div style="text-align: justify"> <B>Reproducibility:</B> The advancement of science depends heavily on reproducibility. We strongly recommend that the authors release their code and data to the public. Authors can provide an optional two-page supplement at the end of their submitted paper (it needs to be in the same PDF file and start at page 11). This supplement can only be used to include:</div>

- <div style="text-align: justify"> Information necessary for reproducing the experimental results reported in the paper (e.g., various algorithmic and model parameters and configurations, hyper parameter search spaces, details related to data set filtering and train/test splits, software versions, detailed hardware configuration, etc.).</div>
- <div style="text-align: justify"> Any data, pseudo-code and proofs that could not be included in the main page of the manuscript due to space limitations.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> <B>Authorship:</B> The list of authors at the time of submission is considered final and any further changes of the authorship are not allowed.</div>
</br>

<div style="text-align: justify"> <B>Dual Submissions:</B> ADMA is an archival publication venue as such submissions that have been previously published, accepted, or are currently under consideration at other peer-review publication venues (i.e., journals, conferences, workshops with published proceedings, etc) are not permitted.</div>
</br>

<div style="text-align: justify"> <B>Conflicts of Interest (COI):</B> COIs must be declared at the time of submission. COIs include employment at the same institution within the past three years, collaborations during the past three years, advisor/advisee relationships, plus family and close friends.</div>
</br>

<div style="text-align: justify"> <B>Attendance:</B> At least one of the authors of each accepted paper must register in full and attend the conference to present the paper. No-show papers will be removed from the IEEE Xplore proceedings.
